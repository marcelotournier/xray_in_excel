# xray_to_xls

Simple python script to show some Computer Vision essentials.

The code transforms an X-Ray image in a 2D Array, and save them on an Excel file

Look at the zoomed pictures:

If you want this nice effect, do this in Excel:

1) Auto adjust column width
2) Turn on cell auto-formatting

Have fun!
